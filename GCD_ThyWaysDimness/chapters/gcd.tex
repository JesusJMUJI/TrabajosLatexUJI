\section{Sound Design}
    \subsection{Soundtrack Design} \label{ost}
        The music would be a mixture of droning and heavy ambient musicakin to horror games on the sections between battles. Combat will use mix of these droning sounds but with \textit{music}.
        The main inspiration of the style of the music is the game \textbf{ÇULTIC} \footnote{Include bibliography reference to ÇULTIÇ}, so a

        Also it would be managed dynamically,

    \subsection{Ambient Sound Design}
        As said on \ref{ost}
    \subsection{Mechanics Sound Design}
        Sounds takes a very important role on the game, vision and light makes the most used resource, but each creatures would make a distinct sound depending on what's it's doing.
        So for example, a basic grunt would make growling as it gets closer to the player and when it makes a leaping attack, the monster would anticipate this attack by making a distinct sound.
        This empowers the player by not making him reliant on only light and aiming.
