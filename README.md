*This page explains it pretty well, but there's a step not explained there so you can follow the rest of the tutorial here.*

1. Download TinyTex from this link-> https://yihui.org/tinytex/TinyTeX-2.zip

2. Extract the .Zip, indisde there will something similar like a *"install.bat*", install it. It will take a will so make a coffee and leave it be until the opened window says "Abort" doesn't say "Abort".

3. When it's done reboot.

4. Install the extension: "LaTeX Workshop" from VSCode.

5. If everything is correctly installed, compile with Ctrl + Alb + B.
